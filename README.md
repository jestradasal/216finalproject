### Using data from the North Carolina Public Schools website, we explore the relationship between average household income, dropout rates, percent of students on free/reduced lunch, and race and gender in each of North Carolinaâ€™s school districts and recent SAT scores. We aim to find a correlation or association in our variables in the last five years, 2012 until 2017.
